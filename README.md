## Challenges
Data Enginnering: 
- Build an end to end pipeline within snowflake
- Reduce the overall cost and technology footprints so that there are less point of failures

Data Formats:
- Customer billing and demographics data saved in semi structured format (PARQUET)
- Unstructured data (emails)

Languages used by Developers:
- Some know SQL, Java, and python
Data Science:
- Cleaning, formatting, transforming and creating a feature store for them to refer in churn analysis

## Machine Learning Pipeline

Run the notebooks starting from 01~ to 03. we will go through the implementation of each one of the steps in the Machine Learning Pipeline.

We will discuss:

- Data Preparation and Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Model Training
- Obtaining Predictions / Scoring
